# First Steps with SnapThink

Welcome to SnapThink! This guide will walk you through creating your first notebook and exploring the key features.

## Your First 5 Minutes

### 1. Launch SnapThink

After installation, open SnapThink. You'll see the main dashboard with:
- **Notebooks sidebar** on the left
- **Main chat area** in the center
- **Tools and settings** in the top bar

### 2. Create Your First Notebook

1. Click **"+ New Notebook"** in the sidebar
2. Give it a name like "My First Notebook"
3. Add a description (optional): "Learning SnapThink basics"
4. Click **"Create"**

üéâ **Congratulations!** You've created your first notebook.

### 3. Test the AI Chat

1. Type a simple message: `Hello! Can you help me understand what SnapThink can do?`
2. Press **Enter** or click the send button
3. Watch as the AI responds with information about SnapThink's capabilities

### 4. Try a Python Calculation

SnapThink has a built-in Python environment. Try this:

```
Can you calculate the area of a circle with radius 5 using Python?
```

The AI will write and execute Python code for you, showing both the code and the result!

### 5. Upload Your First Document

1. Click the **"üìÑ Upload Document"** button
2. Choose a PDF, text file, or CSV from your computer
3. Wait for processing to complete
4. Ask a question about your document: `What is this document about?`

## Understanding the Interface

### Left Sidebar: Notebooks & Files
- **Notebooks List**: All your created notebooks
- **Current Files**: Documents, images, and data in the active notebook
- **Quick Actions**: Create, import, export notebooks

### Main Chat Area
- **Message History**: All conversations in the current notebook
- **Input Box**: Where you type messages and questions
- **AI Responses**: Intelligent replies with code execution and visualizations

### Top Bar: Tools & Settings
- **Model Selection**: Choose which AI model to use
- **Notebook Settings**: Configure the current notebook
- **Global Settings**: App preferences and configurations

## Core Concepts

### Notebooks as Workspaces
Think of notebooks as **project folders**:
- Each notebook contains its own conversations, files, and Python environment
- Perfect for organizing different topics or projects
- Can be exported and shared with others

### AI-Powered Conversations
The AI can:
- Answer questions about uploaded documents
- Write and execute Python code
- Analyze data and create visualizations
- Help with research and analysis tasks

### Local & Private
Everything happens on your computer:
- No internet required for most features
- Your documents and conversations stay private
- AI models run locally using Ollama

## Essential Features to Try

### üìÑ Document Analysis
Upload a PDF, CSV, or text file and ask:
- `"Summarize this document for me"`
- `"What are the key findings?"`
- `"Create a visualization of this data"`

### üêç Python Data Science
Try these commands:
- `"Create a simple plot showing sales trends"`
- `"Load my CSV file and show the first 5 rows"`
- `"Calculate basic statistics for this dataset"`

### üß† AI Assistance
Ask for help with:
- `"Explain machine learning in simple terms"`
- `"Help me write a Python function to process text"`
- `"What's the best way to analyze survey data?"`

## Quick Tips for Success

### üí° Be Specific
Instead of: `"Analyze my data"`
Try: `"Show me the distribution of ages in my customer dataset and identify any patterns"`

### üìù Use Context
The AI remembers your conversation, so you can:
- Reference previous files: `"Use the same dataset from before"`
- Build on previous analysis: `"Now create a bar chart of those results"`

### üîÑ Iterate and Explore
- Ask follow-up questions
- Request different visualizations
- Experiment with different approaches

### üìÇ Stay Organized
- Use descriptive notebook names
- Create separate notebooks for different projects
- Add descriptions to help remember what each notebook is for

## Common First-Time Questions

### "How do I switch between AI models?"
Click the model name in the top bar and select from available Ollama models.

### "Can I upload multiple files?"
Yes! Upload files one at a time, and the AI can reference all of them in your questions.

### "How do I save my work?"
Everything auto-saves! Your conversations, files, and code results are automatically preserved.

### "Can I export my notebook?"
Yes, use the export button to save as a `.snap` file that you can share or import later.
